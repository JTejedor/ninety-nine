# Ninety-nine Code Challenge

## Overview

## Design

## Implementation

 * Due the raw data could be very large, I choose create a file with de transfer data instead of create a large string (avoid possible out memory problems and improve efficient memory consumption)

## Conclusions

* Automatize the entire product over a new release in master to autodeploy in docker hub a new image.
* I would perform more unit test to ensure a better fullfilment, but due to time, I have left only a symbolic record to ensure I could perform test and I understand the full software life cycle
